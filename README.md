# Welcome

Hello, I go by Finder352 but you can shorten it to "Finder" if you prefer.  My pronouns are she/her and they/them, any of those two will do.


### What I like to do

In a general sense, I like to tinker around with anything hardware or software related.  This could be anything from trying to get unsupported software or OSes to run on a machine, to stupid hardware experiments.  In a more specific sense, I primarily find interest in anything within the Apple realm of things.  I collect old PowerPC Macs and have some early intel Macs in my collection as well.  I also find interest in Nintendo consoles and homebrew as well, to a lesser degree.


### What do I run, or what am I working on now?

To be honest, not much.  I kind of just do whatever at this point in time, and my sense of motivation is pretty low right now.  I do however, maintain a macOS InstallAssistant archive on the Internet Archive.  Link can be found at the bottom of this page if thats something that interests you.


### Other stuff

I do some graphic design stuff for my friend speedie, who operates Project 081, a project for getting Mac OS X Tiger on unsupported 2008 Macs, and Forwarder Factory, a place where he creates forwarders and WADs for Wii homebrew.  If any of that sounds like something that interests you, links for those will also be at the bottom of this page
