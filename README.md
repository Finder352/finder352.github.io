# Welcome

Hello, I go by Finder352 but you can shorten it to "Finder" if you prefer.


### What I like to do

In a general sense, I like to tinker around with anything hardware or software related.  This could be anything from trying to get unsupported software or OSes to run on a machine, to stupid hardware experiments.  In a more specific sense, I primarily find interest in anything within the Apple realm of things.  I collect old PowerPC Macs and have some early intel Macs in my collection as well.  I also find interest in Nintendo consoles and homebrew as well, to a lesser degree.
